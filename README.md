Drop all scripts that are in test or incomplete, use the sub folders to best organization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If the sub folder you would use is not in the list, don't be shy to create a new one and commit it.

when starting your job use the command "git pull" to get up to date with the repository.

then use "git checkout -b name_your_branch" to create a new branch, not to fuck with others.

when you are done, use "git status" it will show you what is uncommited or changed, then use "git add 'name of the file you changed'"

use "git commit -m 'what you've changed'" to save all the changes to your local repository

To merge your local branch with the master you have to use the command "git push origin/name_of_the_branch", this will create a pull request, now the only thing you have to do is check the pull request generated and ask for a person with the correct permission to merge it with the master.

Congratulations! you changed something without messing up the codes of other people :D thanks!
